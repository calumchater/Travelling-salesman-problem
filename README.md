# Travelling-salesman-problem
The goal of this code is to find an optimised solution for the travelling salesman problem in R.
It uses a MCMC method, simulated annealing, the metropolis algorithm and gibbs sampling.

Please note that the code isn't yet optimised (ongoing project) as we need to determine the best values for the main loop.
